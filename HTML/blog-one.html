          This week we answered some difficult questions centered around this
          idea of “what is art?”. Although it is difficult to say what exactly
          art is, I think that I can reflect for myself about what my own art
          is, and what it means. For example, I enjoy making things which are
          aesthetic and usually do not have a deeper meaning. My art is usually
          produced through crafts such as baking or cooking - that to me is an
          art form. As such, I think that art in a broad sense can usually not
          be defined, however, I feel like it is more valuable to categories
          types of art forms. For example, Deane (2019) speaks about internet
          art and typical features of its sub-categories. I would argue that
          internet art is art which utilises the internet to communicate or
          display its artwork. Therefore, I would argue that a website could in
          and of itself be an artwork - but perhaps this is a discussion for
          another post. We also spoke about the media aspects within artworks
          (technical, basic and qualified), which could help us to identify if
          our artwork could be considered internet artwork. Overall, I believe
          that art cannot be constrained to one definition, rather, we can only
          catagorise it into artworks which have similar features.

          On the technical side, we covered some of the JavaScript fundamentals
          such as how to create functions, and the different types of variables
          and their advantages or disadvantages. Although these lectures were
          useful in learning how to create a JavaScript navigation bar, I still
          felt that I struggled with JavaScript and make my own functions
          without much guidance. I think that it was because I lacked the
          technical vocabulary to do it.
