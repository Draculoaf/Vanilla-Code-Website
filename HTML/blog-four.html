        My website makes good use of whitespace to avoid clutter, and
        overlapping of elements which might be confusing. The design is simple
        and makes use of few effective elements to communicate to users such as
        colour, contrast (by making only some elements colourful, they are able
        to stand out and be emphasised), and hierachy (the headings are larger
        than the rest of the text, and have thicker lines to make me
        differentiable from the content).
      </p>
      <p>
        The pages follow the same format and look through the website. The
        navigation bar remains on the left side of the screen. In responsive
        mode, it makes use of conventional icons to indicate how the user can
        both open and close the navigation panel on smaller screens.
        Additionally, there is a footer on every page to show the user where the
        content ends. The navigation elements are labelled in a way which makes
        it self explanatory as to what you can expect from each page.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the user interacts with the website, they are given feedback
        through CSS. For example, when a user is in a pagek, the name of that
        page is underlined within the navigation bar. When a user hovers over
        clickable text, the text becomes lighter, and the cursor changes to a
        finger pointer curssor. This is the same with the burger button and the
        cross button. The cards have a different effect, as they gain a shadow,
        however, the cursor also changes ito a pointing finger cursor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I think that my website has very good UI/UX elements. It is
        consistent, simple, uses colours wisely, has appropraite hierachy and
        makes use of elements which are familiar.
