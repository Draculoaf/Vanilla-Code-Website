        <h1 class="p-article-title">APIs and Your Internet Artwork</h1>
        <p>
          This week we learned how to use API’s and what they are. I found that
          the video lucky made was extremely helpful firstly in helping us to
          understand how to get an API, secondly how to read the data the API
          provides and thirdly how to use the information the API provides to
          change elements within the HTML. Last year, it was extremely unclear
          to use exactly how to use API information because the video we
          received was about file conversions, and using D3.js to change CSS,
          and HTML elements. Overall, this week’s API videos were helpful in
          explaining more about API’s.

          For my artwork ideas, I thought I would make either something relating
          to animals, shopping or friendship. For my animals idea, I wanted to
          have a photo in which each pixel represents one animal of a particular
          species eg. more endangered species will have a more pixelated photo
          This would be a commentary on the disappearance of animals on our
          planet. My shopping idea would be setup as a shopping page where you
          could see products of luxury brands or fast fashion brands, and the
          longer you spend on the page, the more filled it becomes with clothes
          that are “thrown away”. This would be a commentary on fast fashion and
          the rate at which things are just discarded. My last idea is about
          online friendships. For this idea, I would make a page which looks
          like a social media chat page, and it would display the progression of
          a pair of friends bonding. The idea here being that online friendships
          are just as important as in person friendships. Currently, I am
          leaning towards the online friendships artwork because I am more
          passionate about the message and have more of an idea of how I could
          make a prototype of it for our first assignment.
