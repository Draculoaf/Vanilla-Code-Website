              Hey, bud. I didn't see that anywhere on the dev blogs. Are you
              sure that's a thing? Sounds like fake news... I can't come on
              today though :(... Got a new assignment that's killllling me!

              Awh! Sorry. I didn't realise you were still studying. How are
              things that side of the world? Are you still studying at... Wits,
              was it?

              Yeah! Haha. I can't believe you remember the name. Things are
              alright, just a bit stressful this time of year, but the weather
              has been absolutely amazing!

              South Africa in June looks suppperrr nice. I can't wait to come!
              You must make sure to keep your promise and show me to all the

              Oh 100%. Just don't tell my mom we met online. You know how
              parents can be sometimes...

              I think she's just worried that I might kidnap you... It makes
              sense. She doesn't know me...

              Yeah, but even so. She just doesn't understand that people can
              meet online these days! She would be all like "but how can you
              call someone your friend if you don't even know what they look
              like".

              LOL. My dad is the same, except he's always like "you shouldn't
              just be telling strangers about yourslef on the internet! That's a
              security hazard!!"

              To be honest, it is though :D. I just wish they would trust us
              enough to know that we wouldn't intentionally do anything to put
              ourselves in danger... Like I'm not exactly iniviting you to my
              apartment for our first meeting, you know? Ugh, anyways. I think I
              got to go do those assignments now. I'll see you later, bud :).
